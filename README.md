# Used-Car-Prices

Project Description

The goal of this project is to determine the factors that make a used car more or less expensive. A dataset from Kaggle that contains information
on three million used cars is analysed, and a brief report including recomendations for the client - a used car dealership - as to what consumers 
value in a used car are provided.


Motivation

This project is completed to fulfill the part of the requirements of UC Berkeley's Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.


Findings 

The four most important features that determine the price of a used car are model, condition, and year. In essence, customers value new cars with low odometer readings in medium to good condition. Further analysis of these columns reveal the following:

    The 1500, Silverado 1500, and f-150 models are priced the highest
    The camry, altima, civic, and accord models are priced the lowest
    
    Newer cars (by year) are consistently priced higher
    2006-2008 cars dominate the low price group
    2012-2017 cars dominate the medium price group
    2017-2020 cars dominate the high price group
    2017 cars are nearly evenly split between the medium and high price groups

    Lower odometer readings are consistenly associated with higher prices
    High priced cars tend to have odometer readings below 50,000
    Medium priced cars tend to have odometer readings between 50,000-110,000
    Low priced cars tend to have odometer readings above 110,000

    Cars in good and medium condition are largely correlated with high prices
    Cars in excellent condition are mostly medium and low priced
    Cars in like-new condition are split evenly between the three price groups
    Cars in fair and salvage condition are mostly low priced
    
Next Steps and Recommendations

    - Customers value recent models, so it is recommended that acquiring recent cars (post 2017) is prioritised; acquiring cars 2008 and prior should not be a priority
    - Cars 2017 and later can be listed at higher prices, while cars older than 2008 should be more affordably priced
    - Additionally, lower odometer readings are valued, and efforts to list cars with odometer readings below 50,000 are recommended
    - Cars with odometer readings above 110,000 should not be prioritised, and when listed, they should be more affordably priced
    - Cars in medium to good condition are consistently highly valued, while fair and salvage conditions are not. As such, Listing cars in good, medium, and like-new condition is recommended
    - Listing cars in salvage and fair condition should not be prioritised. When listed, they should be affordably priced
    - The 1500, Silverado 1500, and f-150 models are most valued, so they can be listed at higher prices
    - The Camry, Altima, Civic, and Accord models are valued the least, so they should be listed at more affordable prices
